if you get errors, type my_python32_path\bin\python sample2.py.
example:
python32 bit installed in
	C:\python
then command line executed in twslink\samples\python\x86 is
	C:\python\bin\python sample2.py


64 bit: 

(prerequisites: 64 bit os, Python >= 2.7.2 64 bit installed (and python64/bin in your path)
open a cmdline window in the x64 directory. type sample2.py.
if you get errors, type my_python64_path\bin\python sample2.py.
example:
python64 bit installed in
	C:\python64
