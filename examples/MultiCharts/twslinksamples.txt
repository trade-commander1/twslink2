 Description: this strategy demonstrates the use of TWSLink2
 WARNING: don't apply this strategy for live accounts. it mostly generates casualties.
 a) connect TWSLink2 to TWS (do this once only)
 b) register MSFT contract (do this once only)
 c) place a buy 100 MSFT shares at market order

{ === how this strategy works ===
A Signal based on CCI signals a long or a short trade. every new trade gets secured by an attached stop order (secition 1.1, secition 1.2).
If the market price moves to your advantage, the stop order gets trailed (no native trail stop attached) (section 2.1,  section 2.2). 
The absolut trail amount is given above by parameter 'ITrail'.
If the price falls below your stop, see parameter 'IStop', your position gets closed and stop order cancelled. {section 3.1, section 3.2}.
if the price falls below your trails stop,  your position gets closed and stop order cancelled. {section 4.1, section 4.2}.
}

{ DLL initialisation}
if Initialized= 0 then begin

	{connect to TWS / Gateway at standard port. make sure TWS or Gateway are setup to operate with API clients such as TWSLink2  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tmypRq5wI)}
	CONNECT("",7496,1,50);
	{register MSFT contract }
	uidMSFT = REGISTER_CONTRACT("MSFT","STK", "USD", "SMART", "", "","", 0.0, "",0,0.0);
	{ place MSFT buy 100 at market order }
	uidOrderMSFT=PLACE_ORDER(uidMSFT,0, "BUY", "MKT",100,0.0,0.0,"GTC", 1,0);
	Initialized=1;
end;

// use TWSLinkBaTe to create your concepts with TWSLink, then integrate with easy language. Good luck!
